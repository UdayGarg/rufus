Beyond their initial use in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, blockchains have become a promising and powerful technology in business, financial services, law, and other areas. This course covers blockchain technology in a comprehensive, systematic, and interdisciplinary way. It surveys major approaches, variants, and applications of blockchains in these areas. Beyond a solid grasp of the principles, the course aims to build familiarity with practice through numerous case studies and hands-on projects. To facilitate its interdisciplinary perspective, this course will be open to two categories of students: students with Computer Science background (graduate or advanced undergraduate), and graduate students with a substantial Business or Law background and a working knowledge of computer programming. Projects will be done in heterogeneous teams combining these categories, and will center on devising and analyzing sample applications of blockchain technology, including both prototype implementations and analysis of its business/legal implications. Topics covered: disentangling “blockchain”; cryptographic prerequisites; assets and their representations; on-chain programming; state consensus; deployments; decentralized applications (Dapps/Web3); protocol governance; protocol revenue and business models; market structure; privacy and authorization; regulation.More information can be found at this link.",

While discussing these abstractions, the course will introduce a variety of type systems and languages that would help us write safe concurrent programs. While discussing these type systems, the course will introduce the unique challenges that concurrency poses to type systems and how they can be addressed. The course will also dive into the deep rooted logical foundations for these type systems via Curry-Howard isomorphism. In this course, students would learn about substructural logics, session types and advanced concepts such as refinement and probabilistic types.

Often these breaches are due to vulnerabilities in the design and implementations of software components. In this class we will study some of the formal tools that have been developed to formally support the correctness of software with respect to security and privacy requirements. We will focus on a few security and privacy properties such as: information flow control and non-interference, provable security, and differential privacy.The course consists of a series of lectures on different formalisms that have been developed to reason about security and privacy properties. The basic formalism we will use is the one provided by relational program logics. We will first study a deterministic logic which is useful for reasoning about information flows and non-interference. Then, we will study a probabilistic extension of this logic which supports reasoning about cryptographic security and differential privacy. We will see how different natural proofs from cryptography and differential privacy can be expressed using this formalism. We will also experiment practically with these topics on different examples by using the EasyCrypt tool.",
